# Hardware Components Project

## About the project
This project is structured into three main parts, each of them being designed to build a complete and functional C# application
In the first part, I had to define the classes required for the app (Components, Compatibilities and Computers), create a standardized form having
data validation, saving, restoring data to/from files. I also developed an interface with main contextual menus
and access to fields via accelerators, intercepting the keyboard.
The second part is about graphical presentation of databases, printing a document and implementation of functions
through drag&drop.
The third part is about storing and retreiving data from databases and creating a user control for use in the form.
